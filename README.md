### The objective is to write a program that takes as inputs two texts and uses a metric to determine how similar they are. Documents that are exactly the same should get a score of 1, and documents that don’t have any words in common should get a score of 0. 

## Requirements?
### The document similarity algorithm does not need to perform well, and don’t need to account for all edge cases. 
### Use 3 sample texts develop the app. Samples 1 and 2 should be more similar than samples 1 and 3.
### Choose any language, but do not import any libraries.
### Examples of libraries CANNOT use
### scikit-learn
### NLTK
### spaCy
### numpy

## Approach:
### Used the cosine similarity formula to determine the numerical score for the 2 strings.
